# ME433spring
## Overview
This repository contains the documentation for assignments in Mechanical Engineering 433: Advanced mechatronics. Over the course of the quarter we learned a variety of skills including circuit board design, communication protocols and familiarized ourselves with sophisticated software and hardware platforms. We eventually used all of these skills to design a mobile robot. 
### Couse Info
Professor: Nick Marchuk

### Languages
C, Java, Matlab
## HW1
In the first assignment we had to familiarize ourselves with the PIC32 microcontroller and its peripheral components and assemble a general puropose circuit board for the coming assignemts. The ojective of the assignment was to build our circuit board and demonstrate that it could make an LED blink at a frequency of 1kHz.
