# ME433spring
## Overview
This repository contains the documentation for assignments in Mechanical Engineering 433: Advanced mechatronics. Over the course of the quarter I learned a variety of skills including circuit board design, communication protocols and familiarized myself with sophisticated software and hardware platforms. I eventually used all of these skills to design a mobile robot.

## HW1
In the first assignment I familiarized myself with the PIC32 microcontroller and its peripheral components and assembled a general puropose circuit board for the coming assignments. The ojective of the assignment was to build our circuit board and demonstrate that it could make an LED blink at a frequency of 1kHz.

## HW2
In the second assignment I designed an EAGLE schematic of my original circuit in the first assignment. [HW2 assignment description](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2018/wiki/HW2)
## HW3
Designed PCB and generated Gerber files. [HW3 assignment description](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2018/wiki/HW3)
## HW4
In the fourth assignment I added an SPI DAC to our original circuit board configuration. I created functions to initialize and communicate with the DAC. To demonstrate success I had the DAC output both a sine wave as well as a triangle wave.

## HW5
Here I incorporated an pin expander to my breadboard and communicated to it using the I2C protocol.
